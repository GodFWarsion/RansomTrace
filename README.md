# RansomTrace: Analysis & Playbook for Ransomware

**RansomTrace** is a modular ransomware analysis and incident response framework designed for forensic investigators and malware researchers. The toolkit provides both **static and dynamic analysis capabilities**, including rule-based detection, sandbox execution, behavioral monitoring, and real-time response mechanisms. It integrates with **FlareVM** and **REMnux** to support comprehensive reverse engineering workflows.

## üîç Abstract

Ransomware has evolved into sophisticated cyber threats involving both encryption and persistence mechanisms. **RansomTrace** addresses this by enabling analysts to investigate PE files, detect cryptographic APIs, calculate entropy, and monitor runtime behavior inside isolated sandboxes. It also follows a structured **Incident Response Playbook** to guide practitioners through containment, eradication, and recovery phases.
