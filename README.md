# RansomTrace: Analysis & Playbook for Ransomware

**RansomTrace** is a modular ransomware analysis and incident response toolkit designed for cybersecurity researchers and forensic analysts. It enables both static and dynamic inspection of malware samples using YARA/SIGMA-based detection, entropy scanning, sandbox integration, and rule auto-generation — all wrapped inside a C# WPF-based GUI.

---

## 🔍 Abstract

Ransomware has evolved into sophisticated cyber threats involving encryption, persistence, anti-analysis, and data theft. **RansomTrace** aims to streamline the forensic process for ransomware by providing a structured platform for investigation, detection, and response. Integrated with the ransomware incident response playbook, the tool automates detection workflows while enabling modular reverse engineering capabilities via FlareVM and REMnux.
